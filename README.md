# CyberRunner2D
 
Build with Unity 2020.3.26f1.

This is a 2D platformer game, where you will wake up in an underground office from which you have to find a way out, and go to the next stage. Collect cards <img src="Assets\Imported\GraphicAssets\IndustrialWorld\3 Objects\ItemCard.png"> to open doors and complete the game. Also, collect as many banknotes <img src="Assets\Imported\GraphicAssets\IndustrialWorld\3 Objects\ItemCash.png"> as possible on the map for future character upgrades.
GLHF.
